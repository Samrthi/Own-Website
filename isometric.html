        <h2>Excerpt from the accompanying essay</h2>
        <p>I had hard time coming up with a suitable theme because historical / fantasy is one of the genres I am personally not very interested in. After some brainstorming I came up with a somewhat unoriginal idea for the level design: The premise of the
          game is the classic “the princess was kidnapped and has the be rescued from the castle of the villain”. I wanted the protagonist to fight a dragon and to give him the opportunity to save his current progress or gain a life if he goes through
          a maze. (I decided on the extra life because I thought it would fit in better aesthetically than a flag or something similar.) The next level would be inside the castle where the protagonist would have to fight more enemies before getting to
          the tower where the princess is held. Overall I mostly used the pen tool and the grid to create objects. For my colours I created a colour palette on the side of my art board with colours I liked so that I could keep referring to them and stay
          consistent with my colour choices throughout my working on this project. I also found myself experimenting with the different liquify tools and different effects for appropriate textures. When I had a 2D image in my head (for example for my
          maze) and wanted a quick view of how it would look in isometric I found the extrude and bevel effect quite helpful even though I would not use it for my actual objects because of the limited customisation possibilities. One tool I also used
          very much is the pathfinder tool. I found it extremely useful when it came to creating buildings or tunnels for the river to run under in objects I already had. With all the water, so my two water platforms and my river, and my backgrounds I
          also experimented a lot with different opacity setting. In the end I always decided intuitively what I thought looked best and most consistent. All together I am very satisfied with what I learned about Illustrator. I feel confident handling
          things and know how to approach different projects. After putting in a lot of work I also finally feel content with my work which is something I was not quite sure would happen after all.</p>
